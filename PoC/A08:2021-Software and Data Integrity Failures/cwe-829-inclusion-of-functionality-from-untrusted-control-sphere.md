there is no specific challenge designed for A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures. 

however, when site scanning using the owasp zap, a "Cross-domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion" vulnerability is detected. 

specifically, the juice shop website leverages a javascript library, jquery, hosted on a 3rd party website https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js

as the 3rd library hosting web site could modify the binary without informing the application owner. therefore violates CWE-830: Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/830.html
